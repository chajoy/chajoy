# About Me

**`Web developer with a creative background in VFX.`**

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a web developer who recently transitioned from a career in VFX to web development. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and building creative, interactive web applications.

## ðŸš€ My Journey

After spending 4 years in the VFX industry, I've built a solid foundation in creativity and problem-solving. Now, I'm applying those skills to web development, where I can create interactive, user-centered experiences. The projects here showcase my journey as I continue to grow as a front-end developer, expanding my skills and gaining hands-on experience.

## ðŸ”­ Current Project

I'm currently building a weather app that fetches data from an API to display real-time weather for cities or countries. The app allows users to search and view up-to-date weather information. This project is helping me build my skills in asynchronous JavaScript and API integration, with a focus on improving my ability to handle data fetching and dynamic content rendering.
